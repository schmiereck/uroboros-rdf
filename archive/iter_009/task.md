# Task – iter_009

**Hypothesis:** baseline: The formal filter identifies at least one non-trivial, reversible, bit-conserving rule for a 1D, 3-bit neighborhood.

## Task

Create a Python script `archive/iter_001/code/generate_rules.py`. The script must be robust and not fail if no rules are found.

1.  **Define State Space**: The 8 states of a 3-bit neighborhood ('000' to '111').
2.  **Group by Hamming Weight**: Group states by the number of '1's.
    - W0: {'000'}
    - W1: {'001', '010', '100'}
    - W2: {'011', '101', '110'}
    - W3: {'111'}
3.  **Generate Rule Permutations**: A rule is a combination of permutations *within* each weight group. Iterate through all combinations of these intra-group permutations.
    - Example: `(Permutation of W0) x (Permutation of W1) x (Permutation of W2) x (Permutation of W3)`
4.  **Filter Trivial Rules**: A rule is trivial if it is one of the following:
    - **Identity**: `rule[state] == state` for all 8 states.
    - **Shift Left**: The rule's effect is identical to a circular left bit shift for all 8 states. E.g., for state 'abc', the output is 'bca'. ('101' -> '011').
    - **Shift Right**: The rule's effect is identical to a circular right bit shift for all 8 states. E.g., for state 'abc', the output is 'cab'. ('101' -> '110').
5.  **Write Outputs**:
    - Create the directory `archive/iter_001/results/`.
    - Save all valid, non-trivial rules found as a JSON list to `archive/iter_001/results/valid_rules.json`. Each item in the list is a dictionary mapping input states to output states.
    - Write a summary to `archive/iter_001/result.yaml` with these exact keys, even if the counts are zero:
      

## Success Criteria



## Required Output

You MUST end your final response with a ```yaml``` code block in this exact schema (the orchestrator reads it to determine success):

```yaml
status: ok  # or experiment_failed or code_error
artifacts:
  - path/to/created/file  # relative to the repo root
metrics:
  key: value  # any numeric results
log_excerpt: |  # last ~20 lines of relevant output
  ...
experimenter_view: |  # your qualitative observations
  ...
notes: brief technical remark
```
